    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cucumber Salad is called Gurkensalat
      in German and is made with sour cream,
      vinegar, and fresh dill. Like most German salads,
       this one tastes best after it has chilled for a
       few hours in the fridge. You can make it up to
       one day in advance! Perfect for a big party or barbecue.</p>

    <p>This easy salad tastes great with fish or meat. In Germany,
          cucumber salad is often served with Schnitzel.</p>
