    <img src="images/cucumber salad.jpg" alt="Cucumber Salad">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cucumber Salad is called Gurkensalat
      in German and is made with sour cream,
      vinegar, and fresh dill. Like most German salads,
       this one tastes best after it has chilled for a
       few hours in the fridge. You can make it up to
       one day in advance! Perfect for a big party or barbecue.</p>

    <p>This easy salad tastes great with fish or meat. In Germany,
          cucumber salad is often served with Schnitzel.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2 English cucumbers</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 tbsp white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp dill</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>black pepper, to taste</li>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Peel the cucumbers if desired and thinly slice them with a mandoline
           slicer. The thinner the better! Put them in a large salad bowl.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, sugar, and
           dill. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Pour dressing over cucumber slices and toss until combined. Cover
          and let chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Serve with a slotted spoon.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
