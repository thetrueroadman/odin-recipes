    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rotkohl has been around for, well, forever.
        And that’s how it usually works, doesn’t it?
        Great dishes stand the test of time.
        And Rotkohl takes the humble red cabbage and
        transforms it into a wonderful dish that
        traditionally accompanies beef roasts,
        Rouladen and Sauerbraten.  For any of
        you who have traveled to Germany, you’ll
        remember this delicious dish.  This recipe
        is like the Rotkohl you enjoyed at your
        favorite German restaurants or in your favorite German homes.</p>
